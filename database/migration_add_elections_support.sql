-- Migration: Add Elections Support
-- This migration adds elections table and modifies existing tables to support multiple elections

-- Create elections table

    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    
    -- Constraints
    CONSTRAINT valid_election_dates CHECK (end_date > start_date)
);

-- Add election_id to candidates table to link candidates to specific elections
ALTER TABLE candidates 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS election_id BIGINT REFERENCES elections(id) ON DELETE CASCADE;

-- Add eligible_elections to voters table to store which elections they can vote in
ALTER TABLE voters 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS eligible_elections JSONB DEFAULT '[]'::jsonb;

-- Add election_id to votes table to track which election the vote is for
ALTER TABLE votes 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS election_id BIGINT REFERENCES elections(id) ON DELETE CASCADE;

-- Update the unique constraint on votes to allow multiple votes per voter (for different elections)
-- First drop the existing constraint
ALTER TABLE votes DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS votes_voter_id_key;

-- Add new unique constraint to ensure one vote per voter per election
ALTER TABLE votes 
ADD CONSTRAINT unique_voter_election UNIQUE(voter_id, election_id);

-- Add indexes for the new columns
