# Placeholder for Architecture Diagram

This file is a placeholder for the VoteGuard architecture diagram.

In a real implementation, this would contain a visual diagram showing:

1. Frontend (React) - Port 3000
2. Backend (Spring Boot) - Port 8080  
3. Biometric Service (FastAPI) - Port 8001
4. Database (PostgreSQL/NeonDB)

The diagram would illustrate:
- Component relationships
- Data flow
- Security layers
- API endpoints
- Database schema

For now, refer to the architecture-diagram.md file for a text-based description of the system architecture.
